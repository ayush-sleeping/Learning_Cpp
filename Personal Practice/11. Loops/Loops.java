	 * Loops in Java allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times 
	 * until a certain condition is met. 
	 * They provide a convenient way to perform repetitive tasks 
	 * and iterate over collections or arrays.
	 
	 
	 
	 * Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
	 * Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
