	/* 
	 * Packages are used to organize and group related classes, interfaces, and other resources. 
	 * They provide a way to manage the code and prevent naming conflicts. 
	 * A package is a container that holds multiple classes and other resources, 
	       and it is defined using the package keyword at the beginning of a Java file.
	       
	       
	 Think of it as a folder in a file directory. 
	 We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. 
	 Packages are divided into two categories:
	              * Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
	              * User-defined Packages (create your own packages)

	 */
	
	
	/* The built-in packages, 
	   also known as standard or core packages, are part of the Java API. 
	   They are pre-built and provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK) 
	      and contain a wide range of classes and interfaces for various functionalities. 
	   Some examples of built-in packages include java.lang, java.util, java.io, java.net, java.awt, etc. 
	   These packages offer ready-to-use components, making it convenient for developers 
	      to perform common tasks without having to implement everything from scratch.
	 */
	
	/* User-defined packages,
	   are packages created by Java developers to organize their code into logical and functional units. 
	   Creating a user-defined package involves placing related classes 
	      and resources in a common directory structure. 
	   The package declaration is the first line of a Java source file 
	      and is declared using the package keyword followed by the package name.

	/* 
	 Advantages of Java Packages:
	 * Modularity: Packages promote modularity in code, allowing developers to divide their code 
	               into manageable and organized units. This makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.
	 * NameSpace Management: Packages help prevent naming conflicts by providing unique namespaces for classes. 
	               Two classes with the same name can coexist if they are in different packages.
	 * Access Control: Packages provide access control mechanisms in Java. 
	               By using the public, protected, and private keywords, developers can control 
	               the visibility and accessibility of classes and members within a package.
	 * Reusability: By organizing classes into packages, developers can reuse code across multiple projects 
	               and applications.
	 * Encapsulation: Packages allow developers to hide the implementation details of classes 
	               and provide access only to necessary elements, promoting encapsulation.
	
	 
	 Disadvantages of Java Packages:
	 * Complexity: Using packages can introduce complexity, especially in larger projects. 
	               Developers need to manage and organize packages properly to avoid confusion.
	 * Overhead: Packages add some overhead in terms of memory and processing time 
	               due to the additional information stored to manage them.

	/* Java API (Application Programming Interface):
	   The Java API is a collection of classes and interfaces that come bundled with the Java Development Kit (JDK). 
	   It provides a set of pre-built and reusable components that developers can use to build applications. 
	   The Java API abstracts complex functionalities and provides a simple interface for developers to interact with.
	   
	   Advantages of Java API:
	   
	   * Ready-to-Use Components: The Java API provides a wide range of classes 
	           and libraries that cover various functionalities like data structures, 
	           networking, file handling, graphics, etc. 
	           Developers can use these pre-built components to save time and effort in coding.
	   
	   * Platform Independence: Since the Java API is a part of the Java platform, 
	           it is available on all platforms, making Java programs portable and platform-independent.
	   
	   * Consistency: The Java API follows consistent naming conventions and design patterns, 
	           making it easy for developers to learn and use different components.
	   
	   * Community Support: The Java API is widely used, 
	           and there is a large community of developers providing support, updates, and new features.

	/*  How It's Helpful:
	 * 
	 * Java Packages and API together provide a powerful ecosystem for Java developers. 
	      By using packages, developers can organize their code effectively, manage namespaces, 
	      and control access to classes and members. This promotes modularity and reusability,
	      making code maintenance and collaboration more manageable.
	      
	 * The Java API offers a vast collection of classes and libraries that simplify common programming tasks.  
	      Developers can use these components to build robust and feature-rich applications 
	      without reinventing the wheel. The API's consistency and platform independence ensure 
	      that applications can run on any Java-supported platform.
	 
	 * In summary, Java Packages and API contribute to the strength 
	 	  and popularity of Java as a programming language by providing an organized 
	 	  and efficient way to build software, saving developers time and effort 
	 	  while maintaining code quality and consistency.
