/* The built-in packages, 
   also known as standard or core packages, are part of the Java API. 
   They are pre-built and provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK) 
        and contain a wide range of classes and interfaces for various functionalities. 
   
   * Some examples of built-in packages include java.lang, java.util, java.io, java.net, java.awt, etc. 
   These packages offer ready-to-use components, making it convenient for developers 
        to perform common tasks without having to implement everything from scratch.
