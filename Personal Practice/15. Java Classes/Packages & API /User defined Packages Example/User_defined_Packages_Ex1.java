/* User-defined Packages (create your own packages):
   User-defined packages are packages created by Java developers 
      to organize their code into logical and functional units. 
   Creating a user-defined package involves placing related classes 
      and resources in a common directory structure. 
   The package declaration is the first line of a Java source file 
      and is declared using the package keyword followed by the package name.*/

public class User_defined_Packages_Ex1 {

	
	/* To create a user-defined package, follow these steps:
	 1. Create a new directory for the package and give it a meaningful name.

	 2. Place the Java source files (.java files) that belong to the package in this directory.
	 
	 3. Add the package declaration to each source file at the beginning.
	
	 4. Compile the Java source files using the javac compiler, specifying the -d option 
	        and the path to the root directory of the package.

	/*
	 Example of User-defined Package:
	 Suppose we want to create a package named com.example and add two classes Person and Address to it. 
	 The directory structure and code would look like this:


      Project
      │
      └───src
          │
          └───com
              │
              └───example
                      │   Person.java
                      │   Address.java
                
                
       */
