		 List interface is part of the Java Collections Framework, which provides a set of classes 
		 and interfaces to work with collections of objects. 
		 The List interface is an ordered collection that allows duplicate elements 
		 and maintains the insertion order of elements. 
		 
		 It is one of the most commonly used interfaces in the Collections Framework.
		 Here are some key characteristics and features of the List interface:

		Ordered Collection: Lists maintain the order in which elements are inserted. 
		When you iterate through a List, elements are retrieved in the same order as they were added.

		Duplicate Elements: Lists allow duplicate elements. 
		You can have multiple occurrences of the same element in a List.

		Indexed Access: Elements in a List can be accessed using an index. 
		The index starts from 0 for the first element, 1 for the second element, and so on.

		Methods: The List interface provides a set of methods to manipulate 
		and access elements, such as add(), get(), remove(), indexOf(), size(), isEmpty(), and more.*/

		 In the Java Collections Framework

		 They all represent ordered collections that allow duplicates
