	/* SortedSet 
	   is an interface that extends the Set interface and defines a set that maintains 
	   its elements in sorted order. This means that the elements are stored in a specific order defined 
	   by a comparator or the natural ordering of the elements themselves. 
	   SortedSet provides methods for retrieving elements in a sorted manner 
	   and performing operations related to ordering.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	Key Characteristics and Features:

	  Sorted Order: SortedSet maintains its elements in a sorted order, 
	  which allows for efficient element retrieval based on the order.

	  Fast Retrieval: SortedSet provides efficient methods for accessing elements in their sorted order.

	  No Duplicates: Like Set, SortedSet does not allow duplicate elements. 
	  It enforces uniqueness among its elements.

	  Custom Comparators: You can provide a custom comparator to define the sorting order of elements. 
	  If no comparator is provided, the natural ordering of elements is used.

	  Subset Views: SortedSet provides methods for creating subset views of the set based on specific ranges.

	  Not Synchronized: SortedSet is not synchronized and is not thread-safe for concurrent access.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	Advantages of Using SortedSet:

	  Ordered Retrieval: The primary advantage of SortedSet is its ability to efficiently 
	  retrieve elements in a sorted order, making it suitable for scenarios where ordered access is important.

	  Unique Elements: Like Set, SortedSet enforces element uniqueness, automatically ensuring 
	  that each element is unique.

	  Custom Ordering: You can define custom sorting orders using comparators, allowing you to tailor 
	  the sorting behavior to your specific needs.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	Optimal Usage Tips:

	  Natural Ordering: Use the natural ordering of elements if it makes sense for your use case. 
	  Implement the Comparable interface in your element class to define the natural order.

	  Custom Comparators: When the natural ordering of elements doesn't fit your requirements, 
	  provide a custom comparator to specify the desired sorting order.

	  Efficient Search: Use SortedSet when you need to perform efficient searches for elements 
	  within a specific range based on their order.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	Use Cases:

	  Ordered Retrieval: Use SortedSet when you need to efficiently retrieve elements in a specific order, 
	  such as ascending or descending order.

	  Custom Sorting: If you need a custom sorting order that is not based on the natural order of elements, 
	  use SortedSet with a custom comparator.

	  Efficient Range Operations: When you need to perform operations on subsets of elements based on their order, 
	  such as retrieving elements within a range, SortedSet provides efficient methods.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	In summary, 
	SortedSet is a powerful interface in Java's Collection Framework that allows you to maintain 
	and access elements in a sorted order. It's valuable when you need to efficiently retrieve elements 
	in a specific order or perform operations on subsets of elements based on their order.
