	/*
	 Set Interface:
     The Set interface is a part of the Java Collections Framework and represents a collection of distinct 
     elements. It does not allow duplicate elements. Set does not define the order of elements; 
     their iteration order may be different based on the specific implementation. 
	 
	 */

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	/*
	 Key Characteristics of Sets:

	 No Duplicate Elements: A Set cannot contain duplicate elements. It enforces uniqueness among its elements.

	 Unordered: Unlike some other collections like List, a Set does not guarantee any specific 
	 order for its elements.

	 Fast Lookup: Set implementations usually provide efficient methods for adding, removing, 
	 and searching for elements.

	 Set Implementations: Java provides several implementations of the Set interface, 
	 such as HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
	 */

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	/*
	 When to Use Sets:

	 Removing Duplicates: Use a Set when you want to store a collection of elements without duplicates. 
	 It automatically ensures that each element is unique.

	 Membership Testing: If you need to quickly check whether an element is present in a collection, 
	 a Set is an efficient choice.

	 Unordered Data: If the order of elements doesn't matter and you need a collection of unique elements, 
	 a Set is appropriate.

	 Efficient Lookup: If you require fast lookups to verify if an element is present or not, 
	 Set provides efficient methods for this purpose.

	 Implementing Mathematical Sets: Set can be used to model mathematical sets, 
	 where elements are unique and their order doesn't matter. */

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	/*
	 Common Use Cases for Different Set Implementations:

	 HashSet: Use when you need fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. 
	 Order of elements is not important.

	 LinkedHashSet: Use when you want to maintain insertion order while still having fast operations.

	 TreeSet: Use when you need elements to be ordered, such as maintaining a sorted collection. 
	 Note that TreeSet is slower for insertion and removal compared to HashSet and LinkedHashSet.

	/*
	 In summary, a Set is a powerful interface in Java's Collection Framework used for storing collections 
	 of distinct elements. It's ideal for scenarios where uniqueness is important 
	 and the order of elements doesn't matter. Different implementations of Set cater to specific performance 
	 and ordering requirements.
	 


     HashSet, LinkedHashSet, SortedSet, and TreeSet are different implementations of the Set interface 
     in Java's Collection Framework.

	 HashSet: HashSet is an implementation of the Set interface that uses a hash table for storing elements.
	  It provides constant-time performance for basic operations like adding, removing, and checking 
	  for element presence. However, it does not maintain any specific order of elements.

	 LinkedHashSet: LinkedHashSet is a subclass of HashSet that maintains the insertion order of elements 
	 in addition to providing constant-time performance for basic operations. 
	 It uses a hash table along with a linked list to maintain the order of insertion.

	 SortedSet: SortedSet is an interface that extends the Set interface. 
	 It defines a set that is always sorted according to its natural order or a specified comparator. 
	 TreeSet is a commonly used implementation of the SortedSet interface, 
	 and it uses a red-black tree to maintain the sorted order of elements.

	 TreeSet: TreeSet is a sorted implementation of the Set interface. 
	 It uses a balanced binary search tree (specifically, a red-black tree) to store elements in sorted order.
	  This makes it suitable for scenarios where you need elements to be ordered.


//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	 So, to summarize:

	 HashSet and LinkedHashSet are general-purpose implementations of the Set interface 
	 with different characteristics related to ordering.
	 
	 SortedSet is an interface that represents a sorted set, and TreeSet is an implementation of SortedSet 
	 that uses a balanced binary search tree for ordering.
	 
	 Each of these implementations has its own strengths and use cases, so you can choose the one 
	 that best fits your requirements based on factors such as performance, ordering, and element uniqueness.
