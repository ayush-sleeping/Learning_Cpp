	 LinkedHashSet Overview:
	   LinkedHashSet is a subclass of HashSet that maintains the insertion order of elements. 
	   It combines the features of a HashSet and a linked list to provide fast insertion, removal, 
	   and iteration while preserving the order of elements as they were added. 
	   This makes LinkedHashSet suitable when you need to maintain both uniqueness and insertion order.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	 Key Characteristics and Features:

	   Order Preservation: Unlike HashSet, LinkedHashSet maintains the order of elements as they were inserted. 
	   Iterating over a LinkedHashSet will follow the insertion order.

	   Fast Operations: LinkedHashSet provides constant-time complexity (O(1)) for basic operations like adding, 
	   removing, and searching for elements.

	   No Duplicates: Like HashSet, LinkedHashSet does not allow duplicate elements. 
	   It enforces uniqueness among its elements.

	   Not Synchronized: Similar to HashSet, LinkedHashSet is not synchronized 
	   and is not thread-safe for concurrent access.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	 Advantages of Using LinkedHashSet:

	   Preserved Order: The main advantage of LinkedHashSet is that it maintains the order of insertion. 
	   This can be useful when you want to iterate over elements in the order they were added.

	   Fast Iteration: Due to the linked list structure, LinkedHashSet provides fast iteration, 
	   making it efficient for looping through elements.

	   Uniqueness: Like HashSet, LinkedHashSet enforces element uniqueness, 
	   automatically ensuring that each element is unique.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	 Optimal Usage Tips:

	   Maintaining Insertion Order: Use LinkedHashSet when you need to maintain the 
	   order of insertion and also require element uniqueness.

	   Frequent Iteration: If you expect to frequently iterate over the elements 
	   and want to do so in insertion order, LinkedHashSet is a good choice.

	   Hybrid Use Cases: In scenarios where you want to balance efficient element retrieval 
	   with ordered traversal, LinkedHashSet can be a suitable choice.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	 Use Cases:

	   Maintaining Insertion Order: Use LinkedHashSet when you need to retain the order of insertion 
	   for your elements.

	   Iteration with Order: When you want to efficiently iterate over elements while preserving their order, 
	   LinkedHashSet is a good choice.

	   Combined Uniqueness and Order: If you need a collection with both unique elements 
	   and preserved insertion order, LinkedHashSet provides both features.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	 In summary, 
	 LinkedHashSet is a versatile collection that combines the features of 
	 HashSet with the ability to maintain the order of insertion. It's a good fit for scenarios 
	 where you need to iterate over elements in the order they were added while ensuring element uniqueness.
