       HashSet Overview:
         HashSet is a commonly used implementation of the Set interface that stores elements using a hash table. 
         It provides constant-time performance for basic operations like adding, removing, 
         and checking for element presence. One of the main advantages of HashSet is 
         its ability to quickly determine whether an element is present or not, 
         making it suitable for scenarios where membership testing is a primary concern.


//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	       
       
       Key Characteristics and Features:

         No Duplicates: HashSet does not allow duplicate elements. It enforces uniqueness among its elements.

         Unordered: The elements in a HashSet are not stored in any specific order. 
         The iteration order may not be the same as the insertion order.

         Fast Operations: HashSet provides constant-time complexity (O(1)) for basic operations like adding, 
         removing, and searching for elements.

         Hashing: Elements in a HashSet are stored based on their hash code, 
         which allows for efficient lookup operations.

         Not Synchronized: HashSet is not synchronized, meaning it's not thread-safe for concurrent access 
         from multiple threads.

       Advantages of Using HashSet:

         Fast Lookup: HashSet is optimized for quick membership testing. 
         If you need to frequently check whether an element is present, a HashSet provides efficient performance.

         No Duplicates: It automatically ensures that each element is unique, 
         which is useful when you want to store a collection of distinct elements.

         Efficient Adding and Removing: Adding and removing elements from a HashSet are efficient operations, 
         making it suitable for dynamic data management.

         Versatility: HashSet can be used in various scenarios, such as implementing sets, 
         checking for uniqueness, and efficiently removing duplicates from a collection.

       Optimal Usage Tips:

         Select Proper Hashing Strategy: If you're using custom objects as elements, 
         ensure that you override the hashCode() and equals() methods appropriately to provide consistent 
         and correct hashing behavior.

         Capacity and Load Factor: Consider setting an initial capacity 
         and load factor appropriate for your use case to balance memory usage and performance.

         Avoid Excessive Resizing: While HashSet automatically resizes itself when needed, 
         excessive resizing can impact performance. Set an appropriate initial capacity to reduce 
         the number of resizes.

       Use Cases:

         Membership Testing: Use HashSet when you need to efficiently determine whether an element 
         is present in a collection.

         Removing Duplicates: HashSet is excellent for removing duplicates from a collection, 
         as it automatically enforces uniqueness.

         Implementing Sets: When you need to model a collection of distinct elements, 
         such as a set of unique IDs or values.

         Efficient Data Management: HashSet is suitable for efficiently managing dynamic data 
         where fast insertion, removal, and lookup are important.


//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	       
       
     In summary, 
       HashSet is a powerful data structure in Java that provides fast membership testing 
       and enforces element uniqueness. It's versatile and efficient, 
       making it an excellent choice for a wide range of scenarios where you need to manage 
       a collection of distinct elements.
