	/*
	 ArrayDeque is a class that implements the Deque interface using a resizable array 
	 as its underlying data structure. It provides a double-ended queue (deque) 
	 with dynamic sizing, allowing efficient insertion and removal of elements at both ends. 
	 
	 ArrayDeque is pronounced as "array deck."


	 */
	
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	

		/*
		 Key Characteristics and Features of ArrayDeque:

	 Dynamic Sizing: ArrayDeque can dynamically resize its underlying array to accommodate more elements. 
	    This allows it to efficiently manage elements as the deque grows or shrinks.

	 Fast Insertions and Removals: ArrayDeque provides O(1) time complexity for adding and removing 
	    elements at both ends (front and back). This makes it an efficient choice for many operations.

	 Random Access: ArrayDeque supports random access to elements through index-based retrieval. 
	    However, it's important to note that this access is not as efficient as in an ArrayList 
	    due to the dynamic resizing.

	 Memory Efficiency: ArrayDeque can be more memory-efficient than some other data structures like LinkedList, 
	 especially when it stores a large number of elements.

	 Not Thread-Safe: ArrayDeque is not synchronized and is not thread-safe for concurrent 
	 access from multiple threads.

	/* 
	 > Declaration and Initialization :
	 You can create a ArrayDeque by importing import java.util.ArrayDeque; .
	 The syntax for creating a ArrayDeque is as follows:
	 (
	 
	 import java.util.ArrayDeque;
     import java.util.Deque;


        // Declaration and Initialization of an ArrayDeque
        Deque<Integer> arrayDeque = new ArrayDeque<>();
       
	 )
	 */

	/*
	 Common Methods in ArrayDeque:

	 addFirst(E element) / addLast(E element): Inserts an element at the front or back of the deque.

	 offerFirst(E element) / offerLast(E element): Inserts an element at the front or back of the deque, 
	 returning true if successful.

	 removeFirst() / removeLast(): Removes and returns the element at the front or back of the deque, 
	 throwing an exception if the deque is empty.

	 pollFirst() / pollLast(): Removes and returns the element at the front or back of the deque, 
	 or returns null if the deque is empty.

	 getFirst() / getLast(): Retrieves the element at the front or back of the deque without removing it, 
	 throwing an exception if the deque is empty.

	 peekFirst() / peekLast(): Retrieves the element at the front or back of the deque without removing it, 
	 or returns null if the deque is empty.

	 size(): Returns the number of elements in the deque.

	 isEmpty(): Returns true if the deque is empty.

	 Advantages of ArrayDeque:
	 Efficient Insertions and Removals: ArrayDeque provides constant-time complexity for adding 
	 and removing elements at both ends, making it a suitable choice for a wide range of scenarios.

	 Memory Efficiency: It uses a dynamically resizing array, allowing efficient memory usage 
	 as the deque grows or shrinks.

	 Random Access: ArrayDeque supports random access to elements through indexing.

	 Queue and Stack Operations: ArrayDeque can be used as both a queue and a stack, 
	 making it versatile for various use cases.





   Common Use Cases for ArrayDeque:

	 Queue and Stack Operations: ArrayDeque can be used to implement both queue and stack data structures.

	 Sliding Window Problems: ArrayDeque is often used in algorithms that require sliding window techniques.

	 Breadth-First Search (BFS): ArrayDeque can be used in graph traversal algorithms like BFS.

	 Dequeuing Operations: When you need to efficiently manipulate elements at both ends, 
	 such as maintaining a history or undo functionality.

	 Efficient Element Management: When you need to frequently add and remove elements at both 
	 ends without the need for synchronized access.



	 In summary, 
	 ArrayDeque is a dynamic and efficient double-ended queue implementation 
	 in Java's Collection Framework. It provides constant-time insertions and removals at both ends, 
	 supports random access, and is memory-efficient. ArrayDeque is suitable for a wide range of use cases, 
	 from basic queue and stack operations to more complex scenarios involving efficient element management.
