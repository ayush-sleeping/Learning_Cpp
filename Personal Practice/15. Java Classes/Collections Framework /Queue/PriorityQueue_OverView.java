	/*
	 Priority Queue is an implementation of the Queue interface in Java that provides a priority-based 
	 ordering of elements. Unlike a regular queue, where elements are processed in the order they were added (FIFO),
	  a priority queue processes elements based on their priority. 
	  The element with the highest priority is processed first.
	 */
	
	
	/*
	 The priority can be based on the natural order of elements (e.g., integers, strings, etc.) 
	 or defined using a custom comparator. 
	 Elements with higher priority come before elements with lower priority. 
	 If two elements have the same priority, their order is not guaranteed.*/

	/* 
	 > Declaration and Initialization :
	 You can create a Priority Queue by importing import java.util.PriorityQueue; .
	 The syntax for creating a Priority Queue is as follows:
	 (
	 
	 import java.util.PriorityQueue;

    // Creating a Priority Queue of integers with natural ordering
       PriorityQueue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();

    // Creating a Priority Queue of strings with a custom comparator (based on string length)
       PriorityQueue<String> customPriorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>((s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
       
	 )
	 */

	/*
	 Advantages of Priority Queue:

	 Efficient Element Access: Priority Queue provides efficient access to the highest-priority element. 
	 Retrieving the highest-priority element takes O(1) time, 
	 making it well-suited for scenarios where quick access to the most important element is essential.

	 Priority-Based Processing: Priority Queue allows elements to be processed based on their importance 
	 or priority level. This is particularly useful in situations where different tasks have different priorities, 
	 and you want to ensure that the most critical tasks are processed first.

	 Automatic Ordering: Priority Queue maintains the ordering of elements automatically based on their priority. 
	 You don't need to explicitly sort the elements; they are always organized in the order of their priority.

	/*
	 Where to use Priority Queue:
	 Priority Queue is commonly used in scenarios where prioritization is crucial:

	 Task Scheduling: In scheduling tasks, you may want to process the most critical tasks first. 
	 Priority Queue helps efficiently manage task priorities.

	 Shortest Path Algorithms: In algorithms like Dijkstra's or Prim's algorithm, 
	 Priority Queue is used to choose the next node with the smallest cost or distance.

	 Resource Allocation: Priority Queue can be used to allocate resources based on priority, 
	 ensuring high-priority requests are served before low-priority ones.

	 Event-Driven Simulation: In event-driven simulations, Priority Queue helps to process events 
	 in the order of their occurrence time.

	 Job Scheduling: In job scheduling systems, jobs can have different priorities, 
	 and Priority Queue assists in selecting and processing jobs accordingly.


//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			

	 In summary, 
	 Priority Queue is a powerful data structure for managing elements based on priority. 
	 It offers efficient access to the highest-priority element and provides automatic ordering based on priority. 
	 This makes it suitable for scenarios where prioritization and efficient access to critical 
	 elements are essential.*/
