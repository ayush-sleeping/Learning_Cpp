	/* OOP in Java : 
	   Object oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
	   ( Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data ) 
	   
	   
	   It provides a way to structure and design programs based on real-world objects and their interactions. 
	   Java is an object-oriented programming language that fully supports OOP principles. 
	  
	  
	   These are some of the fundamental concepts of OOP in Java :
	   * Classes and Objects
	   * Encapsulation
	   * Inheritance
	   * Polymorphism
	   * Abstraction
	   * Association
	   * Composition
	   * Aggregation
	   * Interfaces
	   * Packages
	   
	   Understanding and applying these concepts helps in writing modular, reusable, and maintainable code. 
	   OOP allows you to model the real world more accurately and solve complex problems efficiently.

	/* 
	The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java are: :
	 * Encapsulation
	 * Inheritance
	 * Polymorphism
	 * Abstraction

	/* 
	 Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming :
	 * OOP is faster and easier to execute
	 * OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
	 * OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
	 * OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
