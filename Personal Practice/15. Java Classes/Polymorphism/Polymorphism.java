	/* Polymorphism means having many forms. In Java, polymorphism refers to the ability of an object 
	              to take on multiple forms or have multiple behaviors based on the context. 
	 * It can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading. 
	 * Polymorphism allows for code flexibility, modularity, and dynamic binding at runtime.*/
	
	
	/* Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes 
	          that are related to each other by inheritance.
	 * Like we specified in the previous; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes 
	          and methods from another class. 
	 * Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. 
	 
	 
	 * This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.*/
