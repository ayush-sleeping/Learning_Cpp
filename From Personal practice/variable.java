		 * String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
		 * int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
		 * float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
		 * char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
		 * boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

		   Variable name RULES : 
		    only you can store _ , $ , AlphaNumeric characters are Alphabets and Digits .
		    and when you start naming any variable, You can only use Alphabets, _ , $ in starting of variable name.
		    YOu can also can't use reserved keywords of java in variable name.
